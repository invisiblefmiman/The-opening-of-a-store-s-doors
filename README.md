# Automatic Door System

## Introduction
This project represents an automatic door system for a store, utilizing two servomotors and a proximity or distance sensor to open and close the doors automatically.

The idea is rooted in my curiosity about automation and smart technologies, particularly how they simplify everyday tasks. Observing automatic doors in malls or shops always sparked my interest, as they felt like a glimpse into the future of convenience. I often wondered about the mechanisms behind their operation and dreamed of creating something similar, combining functionality with innovation.

I believe this project is valuable because it demonstrates the practical application of technology in making life more convenient and efficient. For others, it could serve as an inspiration to explore the possibilities of automation and its role in everyday scenarios. Additionally, such a project has a wide range of real-world applications, from retail to residential spaces, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Overview

### Hardware Design

#### Components list:
- 2x Servomotors
- 1x Proximity sensor (or distance sensor)
- 1x Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32)
- Wires and connectors
- Power supply

---

## How It Works
1. The proximity or distance sensor detects movement near the door.
2. The microcontroller processes the sensor's input and sends signals to the servomotors.
3. The servomotors rotate to open the doors.
4. After a delay, the servomotors return to their initial position, closing the doors.
